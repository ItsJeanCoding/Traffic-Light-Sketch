# Traffic-Light-Sketch
A simple traffic light algorithm for Arduino Sketch.

This is a simple sketch on how traffic lights work on highways (except those in the highways lights way longer).
Once the program is executed, it will perform a simple flow on how traffic lights lit and how many delays before the another light lit.

Play with the codes and initializations to learn more about it! :)
